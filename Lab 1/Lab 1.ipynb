    "#### Reward function\n",
    "In RL, the reward function plays a **critical** role in training an RL model. The reward function directly impacts the behaviors that your model will learn, by determining which actions (from each specific state) lead to good outcomes and which actions lead to outcomes that should best be avoided. The reward function contains the “logic” to determine if an action was good or bad, and quantify it. For example, if your goal is for the car to finish a lap around a racetrack, rewarding the car for staying on the track, as opposed to going off the track, is a good starting point. An example of the logic used in a basic reward function that incentivizes the car for staying closer to the middle of the track can be seen in the Basic Reward function section.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left-hand-side of the page, please expand the **Basic function** and choose **Insert code**. This action will copy the basic reward function code to the code editor on the right. **Note** that the code in the code editor on the right will be the reward function that is used to train your model.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Basic Reward Function](img/basic_reward.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "The reward function in the code editor contains the following logic.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    marker_1 = 0.1 * track_width\n",
    "    marker_2 = 0.25 * track_width\n",
    "    marker_3 = 0.5 * track_width\n",
    "\n",
    "    reward = 1e-3\n",
    "    if distance_from_center >= 0.0 and distance_from_center <= marker_1:\n",
    "        reward = 1\n",
    "    elif distance_from_center <= marker_2:\n",
    "        reward = 0.5\n",
    "    elif distance_from_center <= marker_3:\n",
    "        reward = 0.1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        reward = 1e-3  # likely crashed/ close to off track\n",
    "        \n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we first create three bands around the track, using the three markers, and then proceed to reward the car more for driving in the narrow band as opposed to the medium or the wide band. Also note the differences in the size of the reward. We provide a reward of 1 for staying in the narrow band, 0.5 for staying in the medium band, and 0.1 for staying in the wide band. If we decrease the reward for the narrow band, or increase the reward for the medium band, we are essentially incentivizing the car to be use a larger portion of the track surface. This could come in handy, especially when there are sharp corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of variables that you can use to build the logic for your reward function. Note that the reward function has to be written using Python syntax, and we've added a **Validate** button to help you check that your code is good before training begins. \n",

    "\n",
    "Training happens through an iterative process of simulation to gather experience, followed by training on the experience to update your model, followed by simulation using the new model to get new experience, followed by training on the new experience to update your model and so forth. Initially your model does not have any knowledge of which actions will lead to good outcomes. It will choose actions at random as it explores the environment. Over time it will learn which actions are better and start to exploit these. How quickly it exploits or how long it explores is a trade-off that you have to make.\n",

You can always stop training early. Furthermore, if your mode stopped as a result of the condition, you can go to the model list screen, and clone your model to restart training using new parameters.\n",

    "### Step 4: Reward Function Constructors' Championship\n",
    "We are now going to start the Reward Function Constructors' Championship, a short exercise to help build your reward function intuition. The challenge is to build a reward function that can can teach your car to drive from the starting point to the start of the hairpin. Instructions follow below the image. The team whose car reaches the hairpin first, and has a screenshot of the simulator as proof, wins (just shout out when you get there!). \n",

    "Tip: scroll up to the reward function section and look at the advanced reward function examples. What behavior do you want to incentivize to ensure your car stays on track and completes the largest part of the track? You will have to write your reward function using Python in the reward function section, and validate that it works, before you can start training.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of your 10 minutes nominate a team member to implement and start training. You can specify a max. time stopping condition of 45 minutes before you start training. We will not need the full 45 minutes, and furthermore once a winner has been announced you can stop training. In 15 minutes times we will continue with the lab and workshop content, and thus would prefer if only one person is slightly distracted. Before you start training, please also note that it would be best to decrease the number of episodes between training to 5, and also decrease the number of epochs to 3. The last two changes will help your model get more training iterations during the time, which should be good for a straight track model. If you can find a reward function sooner, you can always start training sooner, and just terminate later.\n",

    "The graph on the left is the TrainingRewardScore graph showing the cumulative reward your car receives for each episode. An episode is the number of steps from the car’s starting point and the next termination state (completing the track or going off track). As your model trains you should see the reward line increase, however expect it to fluctuate initially. Once the cumulative reward does not improve much for each subsequent episode it is an indication that the model is not learning anything new and has converged. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also visually inspect driving behavior by looking at the video stream from the simulator. You may notice that your car resets once it drives off the track. This is normal as the car is considered in a terminal state, and resetting it will restart a new episode. Furthermore, the car will reset at subsequent waypoints each time. This is done to help the car better explore the environment. Once you see your car successfully complete subsequent laps on the track, check to see if the reward graph is flattening out. This is a good indicator for you to stop training your model. In the event that your car is not completing the track and your model stops improving, as judged by the reward graph, consider stopping the training and proceed to tweak your model. \n",

    "You can also inspect the Amazon SageMaker and AWS RoboMaker logs saved in Amazon CloudWatch. To access the logs you can select the 3 dots in the top right of your TrainingRewardScore graph, and select view logs or view in metrics.
